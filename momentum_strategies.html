<h2>Directional/Momentum Based Strategies</h2>

<xmp>
    - KEY TAKEAWAYS

    - Momentum Strategies/Trending strategies is designed to take advantage of uptrends, where the price tends to make new highs, or downtrends, 
      where the price tends to make new lows.
    - An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.
    - In addition to looking at swing highs and lows, trend traders utilize other tools such as trendlines, moving averages, and technical indicators 
      to help identify the trend direction and potentially provide trade signals.

<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">
   <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendtrading.asp" target="_blank">Momentum Strategies</a> are generally derived from <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/" target="_blank">Technical Analysis</a> of any security such as Share,Index,ETF and F&O contracts based on price action.<br>
   <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/" target="_blank">Technical Analysis</a> is purely based on Theories driven by prominent Statistican's, Mathematician's which include mathematically driven formula's result's in formation of <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/" target="_blank">indicators</a>.<br>
   <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/overview" target="_blank">List and Type of Indicators.</a>There are 100+ indicators and still counting but some are <a href="https://www.elearnmarkets.com/blog/9-technical-analysis-indicator-tools/" target="_blank">widely used</a>.<br>
   Technical Analysis is bit vast subject but Varsity's <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/technical-analysis/" target="_blank">Technical Analysis</a> chapter cover's most important topics.TA is synonymous with DA(Data Analysis).<br>
   In TA Data is in terms of price(numbers), while in DA data could be in numeric as well as non-numeric form.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px">
  On Lighter Note,during my initial day's I do tried to create custom TA indicator(R&D) and thought of giving my name to it.Though no progress is done ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px"><b>Below is/are some Momentum Strategies I am building/implementing during Market Hours.</b></p>

<h2>1. ATR Based Stoploss Trailing in ETF's (Exchange Traded Funds)- </h2>

<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">ATR Trailing Stop Loss strategy basic functionality/working is stated <a href="https://www.incrediblecharts.com/indicators/atr_average_true_range_trailing_stops.php" target="_blank">here.</a>
        Configuration of ATR indicator is default which is set as 3 x 21-Day ATR in my trading terminal.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">Initiating/Implementing strategy on Major <a href="https://www.niftyindices.com/NSE" target="_blank"> NSE indices</a> such as Nifty 50,Nifty Bank and Nifty IT and buying  
    <a href="https://www.indiaetfs.in/" target="_blank"> ETF's</a> of that particular index such as NIFTYBEES,BANKBEES and ITBEES based on my Entry Points. 
    <a href="https://www.niftyindices.com/indices/equity/broad-based-indices" target="_blank"> List</a> of other indices.
</p>
<h3 style="text-indent:30px">Entry/Initiating Strategy-</h3>

<xmp>
    - Buying ETF(from exchange), when MRR indicating -1% or below, indicate that the particular is near it's bottom and price's will likely to move upward sooner or later.
    - Same can be seen in Viz. I have backtested on more than 15+ year's of data before GA with it.Though I am sharing VIZ of last 1 year of BackTested Data.
      Still the Trend is same of 15+ years of data and Market's (Indices) tend to move in Cycles.
</xmp>

<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">Below Viz Shows Mean Reversion Return(MRR) of 3 indices. When the MRR falls below -1% then it generate buy Signal.Initiate/Enter Strategy after generating buy signal.</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">Do Click on Individual Legends on top left corner in Viz to see individual MRR for indices.</p>
<iframe src="https://divyankm.github.io/Stock-Exchange-Data-Analysis/html%20files/etf_buying_based_on_mrr.html" id="app" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" ></iframe>

<xmp>
    - Rationale behind selecting only 3 specific indices.

      1. ETF of these 3 indices are highly liquid(easy to transact on exchange/secondary market), result in lower slippage while making transaction, otherwise illiquid 
         ETF's can reduce profits.
      2. India's Top Companies are present in these 3 indices such as INFY,TCS,HDFC etc which make it reliable to execute and does not depend on single company result in 
         we are seeing cyclic returns in Mean Reversion mostly moving between -1% to 1%.
         While if Strategy implemented on Single listed company on exchange, the risk increased exponentially so it will be tracking single company instead list of
         group of companies present in Index.

      Off Topic Thought's-
      "ETF's are considered are Great investment instrument's,It provide cushion again volatality and help's in generating returns which beat's inflation."
       Giving Above Statement strictly based on Past Performace(Historical Data),"No Guarantee" can be given for the same in Future in this uncertain world.
</xmp>

<h3 style="text-indent:30px">Exit Strategy-</h3>

<xmp>
    - Selling ETF(on exchange), when MRR indicating +1% or above, indicate that the particular is near it's top and price's will likely to move downward sooner or later
      (for shorter or longer period of time, based on realtime movement of price of indices).
    - Same can be seen in Viz. I have backtested on more than 15+ year's of data before GA with it.Though I am sharing VIZ of last 1 year of BackTested Data.
      Still the Trend is same of 15+ years of data and Market's (Indices) tend to move in Cycles.
</xmp>

<h3 style="text-indent:30px">Another Exit Strategy Based on ATR Based Trailing Stoploss-</h3>

<p style="text-indent:30px;font-size:15px">Once Strategy is Initiated/Entered,a trailing stop loss can be set on indices using ATR Trailing Stop Loss indicator in the trading terminal directly.</p>

<xmp>
    - Entry and Exit's are equally important which will determine the P&L.
    - Exit based on MRR and ATR based Trailing Stop Loss indicator will be different.Will take some time the determine merit's and demerits of both exit strategies.
    - This Strategy is implemented strictly implemented in Cash Markets (on exchange).If transacting in ETF's,it cannot be implemented in Future and Option Market/Segmet(F&O).
    - This Strategy cannot be implemeted on Intraday Basis, It's Cash and Carry(CNC) based strategy. Also Short Selling is not permitted by exchanges(Heavy penalities/fines 
      are applicable) on ETF's which comes under cash segment.
    - Strategy should initiate with buying only, if intiated strategy with selling ETF's will be called Short Selling ,will result in heavy fines.
    
    - Strategy should exit with selling same quantity of ETF which are bought during Entering/Buying Strategy.
      Ex- I brought NIFTYBEES(ETF) at ‚Çπ 167/piece having quantity-500 shares, of value=167*500= ‚Çπ 83500 on 17-Jun-2022, when MRR of Nifty-50 is at -1%.
          After 10 day's on 22-Jul-2022, MRR moves close to +1%, and price of NIFTYBEES ETF was ‚Çπ 182/piece and sold to that price of quantity-500 shares. 
          So Net P&L will be =(Selling value-Buying Value)*quantity = (182-167)*500 = ‚Çπ +7500 Profit.
          Can Verify MRR Returs from above VIZ.
    
    **Like Above Example, Buying and Selling timeframes will depend on buying and exit strategies.(No assumptions are being made)
    - Timeframe to stay put in strategy solely based on decision of executing person, though a set of parameters when to exit are discussed above.

    - From Developer and Scalability POV, this strategy is highly agile,easy,efficient to code,automate,viz/dashboard creation and alert monitoring buying and selling signal
      generation based on MRR parameters as well as ATR Based Trailing Stop loss.
      
      **From my side,this strategy currently implemented in dev env and automation(ETL pipeline/Database/VIZ/Dashboard/Alerting Module) is completed.

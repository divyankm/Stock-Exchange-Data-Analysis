    <xmp>
      Post Automation Probablity Distribution can be calculated using single click of any Stock or Index.
      It gives fair idea about Probability Percent of Stock/Index moving between percent range.

<xmp>
    - Mean Reversion Method is quiet significant in Financial Terms.Mean reversion is a financial term for the assumption that an asset's price will tend 
      to converge to the average price over time. 
    - Using mean reversion as a timing strategy involves both the identification of the trading range for a security and the computation of the average 
      price using quantitative methods.
    
    - Calculating the Mean Reversion Returns from Consecutive Thrusday (Weekly Expiry)-
        Every Thursday Initiating Delta Neutral Strategy, so Mean Reversion Returns gives insight regarding the volatality in Markets.
        Thumb Rule- Lower the Mean Reversion Returns, Higher the changes of NIFTY 50 being in Predicted Probable Range,resulting in low volatality and High 
        Probablity of making Profit.

<h2>Directional/Momentum Based Strategies <button><a target="blank" style="background-color:green; border:none; font-size: 15px; padding: 12px 28px;margin: 2px 2px; color:white;display: inline-block" href="https://divyankm.github.io/Stock-Exchange-Data-Analysis/momentum_strategies.html" title="">Momentum Strategies</a></button></h2>

<xmp>
    Momentum trading is a strategy that involves taking advantage of price volatility and strong moves in prices by buying in an uptrend and selling when that 
    trend loses momentum.
</xmp>

<h2>Pair Trading based on BNF/NF Ratio-</h2>

<xmp>
    - A pairs trade or pair trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling people to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, 
      or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy.

    - Cointegration factor:0.14, Correlation factor:0.88 for BNF/NF Pair for last 1 backtested data.Both Factors will change on Daily Bais.
    - The correlations between financial quantities are notoriously unstable. Nevertheless, correlations are regularly used in almost all multivariate 
      financial problems. An alternative statistical measure to correlation is cointegration. 
    - This is probably a more robust measure of linkage between two financial quantities, but as yet there is little derivative theory based on this concept.

    - Two stocks may be perfectly correlated over short timescales, yet diverge in the long run, with one growing and the other decaying. 
    - Conversely, two stocks may follow each other, never being more than a certain distance apart, but with any correlation, positive negative or varying. 
      If we are delta hedging, then short timescale correlation matters.
</xmp>

</xmp>
    <p><b>Note- In this Example only single pair trade is demonstrated which BNF and NF pair</b></p>
    <p><b>100's of pairs can be created based on correlation and co-integration factors after scanning 100+ scripts on daily basis and pushing alerts during 
  business hours for execution.</b></p>

<h2>MAX PAIN Range for Weekly Expiry NF</h2>
    
    <p>
    Max pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price with the most open contract puts and calls and the price at which the stock 
    would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.
    The Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the 
    strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.
    Max pain calculation involves the summation of the rupee values of outstanding put and call options for each in-the-money strike price.
    </p>
    
    <p>MAX PAIN is useful in determine the range for particular Expriy in which it's going to expired based on OpenInterest(OI) 
      Calculations at each strike and MAX LOSSES occuring at each strikePrice, calculated below for NF weekly expiry.</p>

    <p><b> Post Automation MAX PAIN Range can be calculated for any F&O Script.</b></p>

    <p><b>Calender Spread Strategy went live with Alerting and Vizualizations.
      Currently 10 F&O Scripts are being tested in real markets based on liquidity.</b></p>
    
    <p>A calendar spread is an options or futures strategy established by simultaneously 
      entering a long and short position on the same underlying asset but with different delivery dates.
      Continuous NF FUT Range spread of Current(Jun) and Next (Jul) Month spread range show in below vizualization and condition's 
      when to execute calender spreads. This is Arbitrage Strategy works based on Mean Reversion Method.
    </p>

    <p>Post Automation, when Spread increases or decreases,user will get notification in real time on 
      mobile,email or any messenger apps via webhooks and execute cal. spreads strategy.</p>

    <p>Algorithm will scan all F&O intruments listed in NSE in realtime and generate alerts.Currently 150+ F&O intruments listed on NSE</p>
    
    <p><b>Future Scope</b>- Algorithm will take trade based on 1 year backtested results without any human intervention.</p>

<h2>INDIA VIX Index</h2>

<xmp>
    India VIX is a volatility index based on the NIFTY Index Option prices. From the best bid-ask prices of NIFTY Options contracts, a volatility figure (%) 
    is calculated which indicates the expected market volatility over the next 30 calendar days.

<h2>ML Models-</h2>

<xmp>
     Observations-
     - ARIMA(SARIMA/AUTO-ARIMA/SARIMAX) Forecasting curves/results are turning flat,if trying to forecast results more than 5 days(forecast).As these models are using
       rolling Simple Moving Average(SMA).While Holt Winter Algo is using rolling Exponential Average(EMA) which is tracking close with original values instead of SMA.
       
       Though the markets are seasonal and trending but while seasonality calculation a fixed value cannot be assisgned which will determine "Œ±" as markets are dynamic in 
       nature and seasonality,trends are uncertain in nature, so chances of getting "fasle positive" Forecasting results are very high,same is seen while with actual 
       and forecasted results.

    - Another Algo are more wrapped inside standard libraries (single line of code) like KATS, AUTO-TS, LSTM,DARTS,GREY KITE.Some give near about correct predictions but 
      complexity/performance parameters are poor,required high GPU/CPU power compared to normal while runnig it one by one for R&D work.

    Step's Pending for Testing-

    - Parallel Processing will be one option to execute 5 ML algo's on Normal Machine to get executed below 2-min without any processing issue(High RAM).As more than 100's  
      instruments needs to be processed in real time on hourly/daily/weekly/monthly timeframe.

    - Monte Carlo(MC) simulations will be performed to get best possible forecasted value out of 10 of Forecasted curves/results, along with 1SD and other statistical
      parameters though MC will generate different forecasted curves on each run for same timeframe while other algo's forecasted results will not changed with respect 
      to same timeframe's. 

    - As lot of heavy lifting needs to be performed while building ML Forecasting Algo consist of Multiple ML Models embedded in it for all scripts for Equity,futures,
      Currency and Derivatives. Currently putting on HOLD as plate is already full with some other task which can be implemented in dev env.ML is still in at R&D stage.
    
    - Thoughts/Suggestion on ML Models are always welcome.Currently looking for models which can forecast for small timeframes for example-forecast for next 7 days.

<xmp>
  - As this project is under WIP and timeline of completion cannot be provided (it's depending on Backtesting results on Real Time Data,along with validation of Results 
    in real market), Feel free to connect with me regarding any queries, contributions are always welcome!!! üòÉ
  
  - If any queries do raise PR on this repo in github for any correction/clarification,will be happy to correct/help/solve queries.Timeline to go Live with Viz/Dashboard/
    Alerting to be accessible to everyone cannot be given right now.It's still in premature stage.

  - Working on Frontend Development for first time,not my core skills,trying to improve UI during every update.If anyone want's to improve GUI for webpages, html pages are

<h1>Nifty 50 Index Data Analysis and Forecasting Algorithm Test-</h1>
    <p>In the below viz's,Data Analysis is done on Nifty 50 Index.</p>
    
<h2>Last 1 Year NIFTY 50 Mean Reversion Pct Returns(Thursday)</h2>
    <p>Mean Reversion Method is quiet significant in Financial Terms.Mean reversion is a financial term for the assumption that an asset's price will tend to converge to the average price over time. 
        Using mean reversion as a timing strategy involves both the identification of the trading range for a security and the computation of the average price using quantitative methods.</p>
    
    <p>Calculating the Mean Reversion Returns from Consecutive Thrusday (Weekly Expiry).
        Every Thursday Initiating Delta Neutral Strategy, so Mean Reversion Returns gives insight regarding the volatality in Markets.
        Thumb Rule- Lower the Mean Reversion Returns, Higher the changes of NIFTY 50 being in Range,resulting in low volatality and High Probablity of making Profit.ü§ë</p>

<h2>Holt Winter and AUTOTS Algorithm Nifty 50 Forecasting Chart-</h2>
    <p>HW and AUTO Algo are backtested on last 1 Year Nifty 50 data, Results are not upto mark, more R&D going on with Forecasting Machine Learning(AI,ML) side.
       Though Financial Markets are Trending but without seasonality, so forecasting correct with Seasonality Forcasting ALGO is next to impossible from current results.
       Trying Alternate Algo based on Deep Learning Mechanism and evaulating model performance ü§û </p>

<h2>KATS Forecasting ALGO with LSTM for NIFTY 50</h2>

    <iframe src="https://divyankm.github.io/Stock-Exchange-Data-Analysis/Nifty50%20Last%201%20Year%20Chart%20with%20Actual%20and%20Forecasted%20Data%20using%20KATS%20Algo.html" id="app"  width="100%" height="388" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<h2>KATS Forecasting ALGO with LSTM for USD/INR Currency Pair</h2>
    <p> As Per KATS Model USD/INR value will be crossing 80 rupees in upcoming months due to geo-political tensions and rising inflation and intrest rates along the globe
    Thought the forecasted results are quite unusual, may be KATS Algo is not not in showing exacting future values but able to forecast upcoming Trend, 
    may be it can be wrong,depending on future developments but getting some insights based on data crunching and data analysis working in the Algo.

<p>As this project is under WIP and timeline of completion cannot be provided (it's depending on Backtesting results on Real Time Data,along with validation of Results in real market)

<h2>Pair Trading based on BNF/NF Ratio: </h2>

<xmp>
    - A pairs trade or pair trading is a market neutral trading strategy enabling people to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, 
      or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy.

    - Cointegration factor:0.14, Correlation factor:0.88 for BNF/NF Pair for last 1 backtested data.Both Factors will change on Daily Bais.
    - The correlations between financial quantities are notoriously unstable. Nevertheless, correlations are regularly used in almost all multivariate 
      financial problems. An alternative statistical measure to correlation is cointegration. 
    - This is probably a more robust measure of linkage between two financial quantities, but as yet there is little derivative theory based on this concept.

    - Two stocks may be perfectly correlated over short timescales, yet diverge in the long run, with one growing and the other decaying. 
    - Conversely, two stocks may follow each other, never being more than a certain distance apart, but with any correlation, positive negative or varying. 
      If we are delta hedging, then short timescale correlation matters.

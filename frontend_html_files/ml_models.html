<h2>ML Models:</h2>

<h3>ML Usecase: Forecasting</h3>
<xmp>
     Observations-

     - ARIMA(SARIMA/AUTO-ARIMA/SARIMAX) Forecasting curves/results are turning flat,if trying to forecast results more than
       5 days(forecast).As these models are using rolling Simple Moving Average(SMA).While Holt Winter Algo is using rolling
       Exponential Average(EMA) which is tracking close with original values instead of SMA.
       
       Though the markets are seasonal and trending but while seasonality calculation a fixed value cannot be assisgned which
       will determine "α" as markets are dynamic in nature and seasonality,trends are uncertain in nature, so chances of getting
       "fasle positive" Forecasting results are very high,same is seen while with actual and forecasted results.

    - Another Algo are more wrapped inside standard libraries (single line of code) like KATS, AUTO-TS, LSTM,DARTS,GREY KITE.
      Some give near about correct predictions but complexity/performance parameters are poor,required high GPU/CPU power compared
      to normal while runnig it one by one for R&D work.

    Step's Pending for Testing-

    - Parallel Processing will be one option to execute 5 ML algo's on Normal Machine to get executed below 2-min without any processing
      issue(High RAM).As more than 100's  instruments needs to be processed in real time on hourly/daily/weekly/monthly timeframe.
    - Monte Carlo(MC) simulations will be performed to get best possible forecasted value out of 10 of Forecasted curves/results, along
      with 1SD and other statistical parameters though MC will generate different forecasted curves on each run for same timeframe while
      other algo's forecasted results will not changed with respect to same timeframe's.
    - As lot of heavy lifting needs to be performed while building ML Forecasting Algo consist of Multiple ML Models embedded in it for 
      all scripts for Equity,futures,Currency and Derivatives. Currently putting on HOLD as plate is already full with some other task 
      can be implemented in dev env.ML is still in at R&D stage.    
    - Thoughts/Suggestion on ML Models are always welcome.Currently looking for models which can forecast for small timeframes for 
      example-forecast for next 7 days.

<h3 style="text-indent:30px">HW & MC Forecasting Results:</h3>

<xmp>
      - A Monte Carlo simulation is a model used to predict the probability of a variety of outcomes when the potential 
        for random variables are present.
      - It help to explain the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.A Monte Carlo simulation 
        requires assigning multiple values to an uncertain variable to achieve multiple results and then averaging the results
        to obtain an estimate.
      - It assume perfectly efficient markets.

      - In NF-50 Forecasting use-case,MC publishing 10 possible Forecasting results based on Trained data and final Forecasted
        result will "mean" of it.
      - Another use-case with MC is the geometric Brownian motion (GBM), which is technically a Markov process. This means the 
        stock price follows a random walk and is consistent with (at the very least) the weak form of the efficient market 
        hypothesis (EMH)—past price information is already incorporated, and the next price movement is "conditionally independent"
        of past price movements.

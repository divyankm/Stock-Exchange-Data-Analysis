<h2>Mean Reversion</h2>
<xmp>
    - Mean reversion, in finance, suggests that various phenomenan of interest such as asset prices and volatility of returns eventually 
      revert to their long-term average levels.
    - The mean reversion theory has led to many investment strategies, from stock trading techniques to options pricing models.</p>
    - Mean reversion trading tries to capitalize on extreme changes in the price of a particular security, assuming that it will revert to 
      its previous state.

<h3>Weekly Percentage Returns Calculation for NIFTY on Weekly Basis-</h3>
<p>In below Viz,Percentage Change is calculated based on "Closing Price" of Nifty on weekly basis from-</p>
<p><b>1. Each Thursday > Viz-1</b></p>
<p><b>2. Wed to Next Thursday > Viz-2</b></p>

<xmp>
    - Weekly Percentage Returns are calculated for last 1 year, Max- Last 20 Years of Weekly percent returns can be calculated for observation purpose.
    - But 1 year data is sufficient to understand,how the weekly percent returns are varying.</p>
    
    - Why only Weekly Percent Returns and not other timeframe such as daily,monthly,quarterly,yearl?
      Because Delta Neutral Option Strategies are being built for Weekly Data for Weekly Expires.Though I calculate percent returns on different
      timeframes but not sharing results currently.
</xmp>

<p>Observations on Below Viz-</p>
<xmp>
    1. Weekly Percent Returns are varying mostly between -3% to 3% in both cases above.
    2. When Markets are low volatile especially "vix" < "20",Weekly Percent Returns tries to revert to mean which is 0%.

    Mean Reversion Returns is nothing but Prices trying to revert to its mean values once approach to the extreme high and values.

    In this case,Weekly percent returns above range (-3.1% to 3.1%), will revert to mean.
    For Daily Percent Returns of Nifty,the extreme values are -1% and 1%,calculated based of moving average of every last 5 days.

<xmp>
    ##Finding Probablity of NF mean_reversion_returns(Thu) are between -3.1% and 3.1% based on last 1 year Data-
    nf_mos = nf_weekly_mean_reversion[nf_weekly_mean_reversion['mean_reversion_returns'].between(-3.1, 3.1)]
    print("NF Rows and Columns",nf_mos.shape)
    nf_range_pct = (nf_mos.shape[0]/nf_weekly_mean_reversion.shape[0])*100
    print("NF weekly mean reversion returns between -3.1% to 3.1% is",round(nf_range_pct, 2),"%")
</xmp>

<xmp>
    Output-
    NF weekly mean reversion returns between -3.1% to 3.1% is 82.35 %

<xmp>
    ##Finding Probablity of NF mean_reversion_returns(Wed-Thu) are between -3.1% and 3.1% based on last 1 year Data-
    nf_wed_thu_mos = nf_wed_thu_mean_reversion[nf_wed_thu_mean_reversion['wed_thu_mean_reversion'].between(-3.1, 3.1)]
    nf_wed_range_pct = (nf_wed_thu_mos.shape[0]/(nf_wed_thu_mean_reversion.shape[0]))*100
    print("NF weekly mean reversion returns between -3.1% to 3.1% is", round(nf_wed_range_pct,2),"%")
</xmp>
<xmp>
    Output-
    NF weekly mean reversion returns between -3.1% to 3.1% is 80.0 %

<p>The Probablity of Weekly Percent Returns is nearly 80% for range between -3.1% to 3.1%</p>
<p>Probablity and Weekly Percent calculatios is useful in Building option strategis by keeping wider range > (-3.1% & 3.1%) to avoid losses.</p>

<h4>Mean Reversion Returns of Nifty on Daily Basis-</h4>
<xmp>
    Nifty Daily Mean Reversion Returns Oscillating between -1% to 1% based on last 1 year data. Once NF hits -1% or 1%, it's reverting back to 0%.

<h2>Delta Neutral Strategies-</h2>
<xmp>
    - Delta neutral strategies are options strategies that are designed to create positions that aren't likely to be affected by small movements 
    in the price of a security. This is achieved by ensuring that the overall delta value of a position is as close to zero as possible.

    - Delta value is one of the Greeks that affect how the price of an option changes, would strongly recommend that you read the below page. 
      If you aren't already familiar with how it works.

    - Strategies that involve creating a delta neutral position are typically used for one of three main purposes. They can be used to profit from 
      time decay, or from volatility, or they can be used to hedge an existing position and protect it against small price movements.

<p>Before Diving deeper into Delta Nuetral Strategies,would like to share some resources just to understand all the jargons used in the strategies.</p>

Option Greeks-
- Option Greeks such as Delta,Gamma,Vega,Theta,Rho are all derived from complex mathematical calculation,Based on it the option price is decided/calculated.
- Option Greeks are not calculated for below strategies, but while execution strategy and getting calculated on dev env,but below stat's taken From

    - Currently working on 8+ Delta Nuetral Strategies,4 are stated below.
    - All calculations/statistics are derived mathematically based on formulas,No assumption are being made.
    - Below Strategies are executed after market hours on standalone basis for documentation purpose.

<h3><b>1. Iron Condor</b></h3>

<xmp>
KEY TAKEAWAYS-
- An iron condor is a delta-neutral options strategy that profits the most when the underlying asset does not move much, 
    although the strategy can be modified with a bullish or bearish bias.

- Similar to an iron butterfly, an iron condor is composed of four options of the same expiration: 
    a long put further out of the money (OTM) and a short put closer to the money, and a long call further OTM and a short call closer to the money.

- Profit is capped at the premium received while the potential loss is capped at the difference between the bought and sold call strikes and 
    the bought and sold put strikes—less the net premium received.

<h3><b>3. CE/Call Ratio Spread-</b></h3>

    - A ratio spread involves buying a call option that is ATM or OTM, and then selling two (or more) of the same option further OTM.
    - Buying and selling calls in this structure are referred to as a call ratio spread.
    - There is a high risk if the price moves outside the strike price of the sold options, 
      while the maximum profit is the difference in strikes plus the net credit received.

<xmp>
    Currently in WIP-
    All Strategies will be getting backtested periodically during Market Hours(Real Time) with different set of "strikePrices" only on Wed and Thu 
    for next weekly Expiry to get best Risk/Reward Strategy interms of Profits as well as Probablity of profit.

    Profits and Probablity of Profits are inversely propertional but still Algo will find the right balance as per risk appetite and suggest best
    probable strategy/trades to executes along with all other stat's to have better clarity.
</xmp>
<xmp>
    My Thoughts-

    "No Guaranteed" Returns/Profits can be expected,Even "No Strategy" offer "100%" Probablity of Profits.It's all depend on Market Condition's.

    Atleast by above stat's we can set realistic expection's as we are getting probablity from the past and market tend to perform in similar manner,
    but not the exact way we are expecting.

    Even Further the risk can mitigated by hedging the position/strategies during the uncertainites, Mostly during "Black Swan Events".
    Ex-Covid Lockdown Event after Mar-15-2020,though the "vix", started spiking above 20 even before 1'st Mar 2020 give's an idea of volatality can rise
    in near future.
    Another Black Swan Event on date- 24-Feb-2022 "Russia-Ukraine War",but again vix was above "20" from "14-Feb-2022" which can be refer as Tool-
    to guage volatality. 

    "the eternal truth is: only two people can buy at the bottom and sell at the top – one is God and the other is a liar."
